## Sprint-based Roadmap (Generalized Template)

This document provides a reusable, sprint-oriented plan you can use to organize any small-to-medium project. The plan breaks the work into focused timeboxed sprints that culminate in a completed, shippable project. Use the sections below as a template — adapt sprint lengths, scope, and the number of sprints to match your team and topic.

---

### How to use this template

- Choose a sprint length (common choices: 1, 2, or 3 weeks). Shorter sprints give faster feedback, longer sprints allow deeper work.
- Prioritize work into an ordered backlog of user stories or tasks.
- For each sprint, list the sprint goal, backlog items, acceptance criteria, tasks and a lightweight QA checklist.
- Run a short planning session at the start of each sprint and a review + retrospective at the end.

---

## Sprint 0 — Discovery & Setup (1 sprint)

- Goal: Clarify scope, set up repository and development environment, and produce an initial backlog and project plan.
- Timebox: 1 sprint (1–2 weeks recommended)
- Output / Deliverables:
  - Project skeleton / repo structure
  - Development environment config (venv, CI skeleton, basic tooling)
  - Initial backlog of stories and acceptance criteria
  - High-level architecture or design notes
- Typical tasks:
  - Create repository, README, and docs folder
  - Add coding standards and basic config (formatters, linters)
  - Set up CI workflow(s) with minimal checks
  - Create an example or reference implementation (optional)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Developers can clone, install deps, and run tests locally
  - Backlog contains prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria

---

## Sprint 1 — Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

- Goal: Deliver the smallest usable product slice that demonstrates the core value proposition.
- Timebox: 1–2 sprints
- Output / Deliverables:
  - End-to-end working flow for core feature(s)
  - Minimal CLI / UI or API to exercise features
  - Tests that cover the main happy-path scenarios
- Typical tasks:
  - Implement core modules and glue code
  - Add basic input validation and error handling
  - Write smoke tests and example usage in README
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Core features work end-to-end for typical inputs
  - Tests pass for the happy path
  - Minimal documentation explains how to run the MVP

---

## Sprint 2 — Robustness & Validation

- Goal: Strengthen input validation, handle edge cases, and add defensive error handling.
- Timebox: 1 sprint
- Output / Deliverables:
  - Improved validation and comprehensive error paths
  - Custom error types or structured error handling
  - Tests for common edge cases and failure modes
- Typical tasks:
  - Implement and test validation rules and boundary cases
  - Add logging and structured error messages
  - Add tests that assert expected error codes/messages
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Edge-case tests pass
  - Errors include useful debugging context without leaking secrets

---

## Sprint 3 — Features, UX & Documentation

- Goal: Add secondary features, improve developer/user experience, and document project usage.
- Timebox: 1–2 sprints
- Output / Deliverables:
  - Additional features or commands
  - CLI help, UX improvements, and user-facing docs
  - Examples and how-to guides
- Typical tasks:
  - Enhance CLI/UI with flags and help
  - Add examples demonstrating patterns and usage
  - Expand README and docs (getting started, troubleshooting)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Users can discover features through help and docs
  - Examples are runnable and reproduce expected outputs

---

## Sprint 4 — Quality, Automation & Security

- Goal: Harden the project with CI, tests, type checks, security scans, and performance tuning.
- Timebox: 1 sprint
- Output / Deliverables:
  - CI pipeline with test, lint, typecheck, and security steps
  - Test coverage targets or improvement plan
  - Basic performance and resource checks (if relevant)
- Typical tasks:
  - Add/finish GitHub Actions or similar CI
  - Add unit and integration tests to raise coverage
  - Run bandit/pip-audit and address critical findings
- Acceptance criteria:
  - CI runs and passes for the main branch (or a documented exception policy)
  - No critical security findings unaddressed

---

## Sprint 5 — Polish, Release & Handover

- Goal: Final polish, release packaging, and handover documentation.
- Timebox: 1 sprint
- Output / Deliverables:
  - Release artifact (package, binary, or release notes)
  - Detailed contribution guide and maintenance notes
  - Post-release checklist and monitoring plan (if applicable)
- Typical tasks:
  - Prepare changelog and release notes
  - Tag a release and publish artifacts
  - Run final cross-platform smoke tests
  - Conduct handover and knowledge-transfer sessions
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Release artifacts published and downloadable
  - Documentation sufficient for maintainers to take over

---

## Optional/Extended Sprints

- Internationalization, accessibility, or compliance work
- Significant performance optimization and benchmarking
- Full audit and remediation for security & privacy at scale
- Community building: examples, tutorials, and outreach

---

## Sprint planning template (use per sprint)

- Sprint #: <number>
- Timebox: <1/2/3 weeks>
- Sprint goal (1 sentence):
- Success criteria / Definition of Done (DoD):
  - [ ] Acceptance tests pass
  - [ ] Code reviewed and merged
  - [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
  - [ ] CI passes
- Backlog items (prioritized):
  1. User story / task title — short description
     - Task subtasks: code, tests, docs, review
     - Estimate: <story points or hours>
- Risks / blockers:
- Notes for next sprint:

---

## Practical tips

- Keep sprints small and focused. If scope grows, split into multiple sprints.
- Use the MVP mindset: deliver the smallest usable slice first, then iterate.
- Automate checks early (format, lint, typecheck). CI will save time.
- Make acceptance criteria concrete and testable.
- Reserve at least 10–20% of sprint capacity for bug fixes, reviews, and unexpected work.

## Closing notes

This template is intentionally generic so it fits many topics: CLI tools, libraries, web apps, data pipelines, or educational projects. Copy this file into your project docs and adapt sprint goals, timeboxes, and acceptance criteria to your context.

If you'd like, I can:
- generate a project-specific sprint schedule based on an existing backlog
- produce issue templates you can paste into GitHub for each sprint
- create a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to reflect Sprint 4 tasks

Place this file in your documentation and tweak the steps to match your team's cadence.
